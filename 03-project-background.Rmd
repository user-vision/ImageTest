# Project Background {-}
<!-- USE PROJECT CONTRACT FOR PROJECT BACKGROUND -->
**INSERT CLIENT NAME** have approached User Vision to perform an accessibility audit of  **INSERT PLATFORM** on desktop on mobile.

The audit is designed to capture accessibility issues so that **THE CLIENT** can ensure the website provides an accessible experience to customers and ensure that they are in control of the interface they are interacting with.

The goal is to help make sure that this site is accessible to the widest possible audience by complying with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA. 

## Approach {-}
<!-- UPDATE AS APPROPRIATE -->

The following approach was taken for the accessibility audit by a team of experienced accessibility consultants from User Vision.

- Automated testing using Accessibility Insights and Powermapper. 

- Manual accessibility evaluation to code level using browser code inspectors, an approach that identifies issues that cannot be captured by automated tools.

- We viewed the application in a range of browsers:
    - Chrome, Firefox and IE on desktop.
    - Safari on iPad & iPhone.

- We assessed pages using the following assistive technology:
    - NVDA (with Firefox and Chrome) screen reader for desktop.
    - VoiceOver for iPad & iPhone (iOS).
    - Talkback for Android 

- We checked colour combinations using a colour contrast analyser to determine if there is enough contrast in the visual presentation.
