# Suggested Next Steps {-}

What we recommend happens next. 

- Consider the recommended changes in priority order
- Conduct a usability test of the site to discover other contextual issues and better understand the impact of those issues already identified
- Review and revise the information architecture of the site to improve the findability and navigability of content.  Methods such as card sorting and tree testing will provide a clear framework for users to navigate.
- Conduct a full accessibility audit to identify barriers to accessibility site-wide
- Adopt a program of iterative testing to ensure that the experience of the site is always paramount
- Testing and evaluating early and often reduces effort and saves development time and costs
